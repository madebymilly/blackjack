# BlackJack

Project from 2018. I have started building BlackJack in object oriented JavaScript. I have added a bit of functionality (ES6) in March/April 2019, to make the code more ease to read. It still contains a bit of jQuery, next step would be to remove that. Project is not finished, but I had learned what I wanted. I am currently working on a React version of BlackJack.

Techniques: Functional JavaScript (ES6) (Webpack/Babel and a tiny bit of jQuery (oops!)
